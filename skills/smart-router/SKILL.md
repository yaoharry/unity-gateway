# Smart Router

Use the Python executable exported by the launching Unity Gateway installation.
Keep its path quoted and do not substitute `ug` or `python` from PATH.

- In Claude Code, run exactly `"$UCODE_SMART_ROUTER_PYTHON" -m ucode.cli claude --enable-smart-routing` for `on` or
  `"$UCODE_SMART_ROUTER_PYTHON" -m ucode.cli claude --disable-smart-routing` for `off`.
- In Codex, run exactly `"$UCODE_SMART_ROUTER_PYTHON" -m ucode.cli codex --enable-smart-routing` for `on` or
  `"$UCODE_SMART_ROUTER_PYTHON" -m ucode.cli codex --disable-smart-routing` for `off`.

In PowerShell, use `& "$env:UCODE_SMART_ROUTER_PYTHON"` in place of
`"$UCODE_SMART_ROUTER_PYTHON"`; keep the remaining arguments the same.
If `UCODE_SMART_ROUTER_PYTHON` or `UCODE_SESSION_ENV_FILE` is unset, ask the user
to restart through an updated Unity Gateway with smart routing enabled.

With no argument, explain that only `on` and `off` are accepted. Do not edit the state file.
This affects subsequent subagent model selection and automatic orchestration in the current
session, not the root model or first prompt. When turned off, earlier orchestrate instructions
are superseded: continue in the root and do not start new automatic delegation or fall back to
default role models. Existing children can finish. When turned on, apply the orchestrate skill
to further work. Return the command's result.
