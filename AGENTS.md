# Agent Instructions

## Project

Unity Gateway (`ug`) is a Python CLI that configures and launches coding agents through Databricks
AI Gateway. Its internal Python package remains named `ucode` for backward compatibility.

The package code lives in `src/ucode/`.
Tests live in `tests/`.

## Commands

- Run the full test suite with `uv run pytest`.
- Run focused tests with `uv run pytest tests/<file>.py`.
- Run e2e tests with `UCODE_TEST_WORKSPACE=<db_workspace_url> uv run pytest tests/test_e2e.py -v`.
- Run the lint gate (ruff check + ruff format check + ty) with `just lint`; `just fix` autofixes. These are the same checks CI's Lint job runs. Without `just` installed, use `uvx --from rust-just just lint`, or run the underlying `uv run ruff ...` / `uv run ty ...` commands directly.
- Run the CLI from the current checkout with `uv run ug ...`.
- Reinstall the local checkout as the Unity Gateway tool with `uv tool install --reinstall .`.

## Development

- Use Python 3.12+.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested behavior.
- Follow the existing module boundaries: CLI orchestration in `cli.py`, agent-specific behavior in `agents/<name>.py`, shared agent dispatch in `agents/__init__.py`, Databricks calls in `databricks.py`, skill download (UC fetch client + on-disk writer + download orchestration) in `skills_download.py`, MCP-connection state glue in `mcp.py`, and presentation helpers in `ui.py`. Skill download persists no disk state — it writes files to `--path` (or the home dir) and registers only the schema-less skills MCP connection. `ug configure skills` with no `--location` (or `--mcp` with no `--location`) registers that schema-less connection without downloading anything.
- Prefer existing helpers for config file writes, state persistence, UI messages, and Databricks authentication.
- Use `ucode.os_compatibility.subprocess_cross_os.run` / `ucode.os_compatibility.subprocess_cross_os.popen` for subprocesses; they resolve Windows npm wrappers automatically and default text streams to UTF-8 with replacement for invalid bytes. Keep commands as argument lists. Do not repeat these encoding defaults at callsites; explicit encoding/error overrides and binary mode remain supported. Ruff rejects direct `subprocess.run` / `subprocess.Popen` calls outside `os_compatibility/subprocess_cross_os.py` and tests.
- Use `acquire_exclusive_file_lock` / `release_file_lock` from `ucode.os_compatibility.file_lock_cross_os` instead of calling `fcntl.flock`, `fcntl.lockf`, or `msvcrt.locking` directly. Ruff enforces this outside the compatibility module and tests.
- Use `launcher.exec_or_spawn` when handing the terminal to an agent. Shell strings and explicit executable overrides keep their existing subprocess semantics.
- Add or update focused tests for behavior changes.
- Do not modify generated or lock files unless the dependency graph intentionally changes.

## Style

- Keep user-facing CLI errors actionable.
- Use warnings for recoverable setup problems and errors for launch/runtime blockers.
- Preserve existing Rich UI conventions, including `print_warning`, `print_err`, `print_success`, `print_section`, and `spinner`.
- Avoid broad refactors while fixing a narrow bug.

## Fields `ug` manages

This is the allow list of fields `ug` owns. Every field not listed is left
alone. For each listed field, `ug` does one of:

- **Create/replace**: `ug` owns the whole value and writes it.
- **Merge**: `ug` writes only its own entries within a shared value and leaves the rest alone.
- **Ignore**: `ug` does not touch the field.

The two columns show what `ug` does without and with a [managed config](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ai-gateway/coding-agent-configure-govern), the coding agent config admins publish through the API.

This is the intended behavior; we are still working to make the code match it in every case. In particular, `ug` today also clears some fields that this list leaves alone: the `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL_NAME` companions, `env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY`, `env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS`, and Codex `model_reasoning_effort`. Codex `[otel]` is never written to a file.

<summary>Claude Code</summary>

Fields live in `~/.claude/ucode-settings.json` and the OS-managed settings file (`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json` on Linux, `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS), which takes precedence.

| Field | Without managed config | With managed config | Notes |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| `apiKeyHelper` | Create/replace | Create/replace | Gateway auth-token helper |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Create/replace | Create/replace | Gateway endpoint URL |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` | Merge | Merge | Merge `ug`'s routing and attribution headers by name; other header lines left alone. Admin headers added under managed config |
| `env.CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` | Create/replace | Create/replace | Auth-helper cache TTL |
| `env.ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` | Create/replace | Create/replace | Prompt-caching flag |
| `env.ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` | Create/replace | Create/replace | Tool-search flag |
| `env.CLAUDE_CODE_USE_GATEWAY` | Create/replace | Create/replace | Gateway-routing flag |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | Ignore | Create/replace | Launch model, from the config's `default_model` or the budget recommendation when spend tiers are set; written at launch, not by `ug configure` |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` | Create/replace | Create/replace | Per-family default (opus, sonnet, haiku, fable); the config's family default wins under managed config |
| Model picker | Ignore | Create/replace | `availableModels`, `enforceAvailableModels`, `modelPicker`; only for a managed static model list |
| `permissions.deny` | Merge | Merge | Add `ug`'s own `WebSearch` rule when it replaces web search; other rules left alone |
| Tracing | Ignore | Create/replace | The seven `CLAUDE_CODE_*`/`OTEL_*` trace keys and `otelHeadersHelper`; only when the config enables tracing |
| `managedMcpServers` | Ignore | Merge | Add/update the config's MCP server entries; other entries left alone |
| Smart-routing hooks | Merge | Merge | `PreToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `SubagentStart`; only `ug`'s own marked handlers, other hooks left alone |
| Orchestrator hooks | Merge | Merge | Launch-only `UserPromptSubmit` and compact `SessionStart` handlers for smart-routed sessions; read the same session controls as routing |
| `enabledPlugins["model-orchestrator@…"]` | Merge | Merge | Launch-only `false` overrides for installed legacy plugins, even when smart routing is off; saved settings and other plugins left alone |
